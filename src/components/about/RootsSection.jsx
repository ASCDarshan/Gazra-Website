              <p>
                Founded in Vadodara, Gazra emerged from the vision of creating a
                safe and inclusive space for the LGBTQIA+ community. Our journey
                began with small community meetups and has grown into a vibrant
                organization that serves and supports hundreds of individuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The inspiration for Gazra came from the rich history of Shri
                Chimnabai Stree Udhyogalay, an institution that has been
                empowering marginalized communities for generations. We carry
                forward this legacy of social change and community support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue to build on these strong foundations,
                expanding our reach and impact while staying true to our core
                values of inclusivity, support, and community building.
